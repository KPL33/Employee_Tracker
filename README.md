# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

 • Build CLI that allows users to view and interact with info in a  db.
 • using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
 • √ run `npm i inquirer@8.2.4`.
 • √ install mysql2 package.
 • make walkthrough video that demonstrates functionality and all acceptance criteria.
 • submit link to vid and add it to the README of your project.

• LOOK AT PROVIDED MOCK-UP VID. Design schema following examples.

* `department`

    * `id`: `INT PRIMARY KEY`

    * `name`: `VARCHAR(30)` to hold department name

* `role`

    * `id`: `INT PRIMARY KEY`

    * `title`: `VARCHAR(30)` to hold role title

    * `salary`: `DECIMAL` to hold role salary

    * `department_id`: `INT` to hold reference to department role belongs to

* `employee`

    * `id`: `INT PRIMARY KEY`

    * `first_name`: `VARCHAR(30)` to hold employee first name

    * `last_name`: `VARCHAR(30)` to hold employee last name

    * `role_id`: `INT` to hold reference to employee role

    * `manager_id`: `INT` to hold reference to another employee that is the manager of the current employee (`null` if the employee has no manager)

You might want to use a separate file that contains functions for performing specific SQL queries you'll need to use. A constructor function or class could be helpful for organizing these. You might also want to include a `seeds.sql` file to pre-populate your database, making the development of individual features much easier.

• You might also want to make your queries asynchronous. MySQL2 exposes a `.promise()` function on Connections to upgrade an existing non-Promise connection to use Promises. To learn more and make your queries asynchronous, refer to the [npm documentation on MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2).
• CLI accepts user input
• at app start, (npm run start or node index?) presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role (get clues from shape challenge)
• Viewing all departments presents user with a formatted table showing department names and department ids.
• Choosing to view all roles presents user with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
• Choosing 'view all employees' presents user with formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
• Choosing 'add a department' prompts user to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database
• Choosing to add a role prompts user to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database
• Choosing to add an employee prompts user to enter the employee’s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database
• Choosing 'update an employee role' prompts user to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database 

## Bonus

Try to add some additional functionality to your application, such as the ability to do the following:

* Update employee managers.

* View employees by manager.

* View employees by department.

* Delete departments, roles, and employees.

* View the total utilized budget of a department&mdash;in other words, the combined salaries of all employees in that department.

## Grading Requirements

> **Note**: If a Challenge assignment submission is marked as “0”, it is considered incomplete and will not count towards your graduation requirements. Examples of incomplete submissions include the following:
>
> * A repository that has no code
>
> * A repository that includes a unique name but nothing else
>
> * A repository that includes only a README file but nothing else
>
> * A repository that only includes starter code

This Challenge is graded based on the following criteria:

### Deliverables: 10%

* Your GitHub repository containing your application code.

### Walkthrough Video: 27%

* A walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the employee tracker must be submitted, and a link to the video should be included in your README file.

* The walkthrough video must show all of the technical acceptance criteria being met.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate how a user would invoke the application from the command line.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate a functional menu with the options outlined in the acceptance criteria.

### Technical Acceptance Criteria: 40%

* Satisfies all of the preceding acceptance criteria plus the following:

    * Uses the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4).

    * Uses the [MySQL2 package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) to connect to a MySQL database.

* Follows the table schema outlined in the Challenge instructions.

### Repository Quality: 13%

* Repository has a unique name.

* Repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions.

* Repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.

* Repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages.

* Repository contains a high-quality README with description and a link to a walkthrough video.

### Application Quality 10%

* The application user experience is intuitive and easy to navigate.

### Bonus

Fulfilling any of the following can add up to 20 points to your grade. Note that the highest grade you can achieve is still 100:

* Application allows users to update employee managers (2 points).

* Application allows users to view employees by manager (2 points).

* Application allows users to view employees by department (2 points).

* Application allows users to delete departments, roles, and employees (2 points for each).

* Application allows users to view the total utilized budget of a department&mdash;in other words, the combined salaries of all employees in that department (8 points).

## Review

You are required to submit BOTH of the following for review:

* A walkthrough video demonstrating the functionality of the application.

* The URL of the GitHub repository, with a unique name and a README describing the project.
