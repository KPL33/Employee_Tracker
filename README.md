## Overview

## Application Instructions
• To run the app, you must first log-on with your MySQL credentials from your CLI.
• Then, run "SOURCE schema.sql" and "SOURCE seeds.sql".

• Once the database is ready, open another CLI and enter "node index.js" from your root folder.

• Select the option you'd like to view or update, with the arrow keys on your keyboard and hit enter to continue.
• Follow prompts to carry out your chosen task.
